## Contributing

We appreciate you taking the initiative to contribute to this project.

Contributing isn’t limited to just code. We encourage you to contribute in the way that best fits your abilities, by 
writing tutorials, giving a demo at your local meetup, helping other users with their support questions, or revising our
 documentation.

## Development

To setup a development environment for code contributions, follow instructions below. Execution of the extension is done
within a dockerized environment (only tested under Linux). Editing can still be done outside of docker as the current directory is mounted into
the docker environment.

Place wp-cli binary in the bin folder. According to current documentation from WP-CLI you would want to do something 
like: 
       
       cd bin 
       curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
       chmod +x wp-cli.phar
       mv wp-cli.phar wp
       
Create a docker environment and bring it up like this:
   
       docker-compose up -d
       
Enter your dev environment and create a fresh wordpress installation to test against

       docker exec -ti wpsec-phpcli /bin/bash
       
[Install composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) and run

       mkdir testsite && cd testsite
       wp core download
       wp core config --dbname=database --dbuser=user --dbpass=password --dbhost=wpsec-mysql
       wp core install --url=http://localhost --title=testsite --admin_user=admin --admin_password=admin --admin_email=mail@mail.com --skip-email
       
Running

       wp wp-sec check
       
Running testsuite
       
       vendor/bin/behat --strict
